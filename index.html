      <p>Note: if this is just an empty box, something went wrong.  Try
         Firefox.
      <p>Here is a password generator for the classic NES game,
         The Battle of Olympus.  A few notes:
         Of the eight unknown bits (other than 95 which just seems to cause glitches
         and is not set on any password I've seen), I imagine they have to do
         with the Centaur and/or Ladon, and things in Crete, Phrygia, and Tartarus.
         I haven't have a chance to investigate these areas thoroughly yet.
      <p>At some point I'll go into more detail about the encoding.
      <p>Since there are two full checksum characters, only one in 4096=2^12
         passwords are valid, which explains why guessing always fails so
         miserably.  There is also a redundancy of 64 different encodings of
         the same information.  This shows up as a freedom to cycle the characters.
         I therefore hold the second character constant (since the checksum character
         is no good for this), so that changes only affect the parts of the password
         to their right.
      <p>The maximum number of salamander skins is 31.
      <p>I think the max life is 56 with the golden apple, 28 without.  But
         up to 63 can be entered without a problem.  Starting with only 1 life
         is glitched for me.  Zero is allowed, but I promise you won't get far.
      <p>The situation where Hermes is summoned to Zeus consists of three regular
         states and one <em>invalid</em> state. The invalid state is not reachable
         during regular gameplay, but can be achieved using the passwords. All of
         these states require that Zeus has been spoken to. Otherwise it will be
         Zeus in the temple, even with the Hermes-bit set.
         The states are:
         <ol start='0'>
            <li>Zeus has been spoken to, and remains in his temple. Hermes has left a retainer in his temple (sandals+hermes-bits: unset).
            <li>You've spoken to the retainer in Hermes' temple (this is when the hermes-bit is set). Now Hermes is in Zeus' Temple.
            <li>You've obtained the sandals from Hermes at Zeus' temple. Upon leaving and returning, both gods will now be in their own temples. The hermes-bit is unset immediately when you obtain the sandals. (sandals: set, hermes-bit: unset)
            <li><strong>Invalid:</strong> You've obtained the sandals AND set the Hermes-bit. Hermes will give you a password if you speak to him. He will also be in both his and Zeus' temple if you visit them. (sandals: set, hermes-bit: set)
         </ol>
             
      <p>So far the decoding mechanism does not deal gracefully with bad
         passwords.  It should be possible to change only the first and
         last character to fix the checksums.  But for some reason, when
         you enter a bad password, it changes more than that.  I've also
         got a few strange javascript errors I'm not sure how to deal with.
         Regardless, it seems to work fine in Firefox 1.5.
      <p>I've written a utility to enter passwords into an emulator
         window automatically (in Linux at least), and may post it at some
         point.
      <p>The inspiration to crack this game, as well as how to write such
         a javascript application are due primarily to Bisqwit 
         (http://iki.fi/bisqwit/) and I am therefore grateful for his work.

      <h2>Coding Scheme</h2>
      <p>BoO passwords have 26 characters from an alphabet of 64.  In order,
         0-9 correspond to 0x00-0x09, A-Z to 0x0A-0x24, a-z to 0x25-0x3D, and
         ? and ! to 0x3E and 0x3F.  Thus, each character is 6 bits, and all arithmetic
         we will do from now on is thus modulo 64.
      <p>The actual information content of the password is 23 characters long.
         Two characters are used for checksums and one is arbitrary.  Call the
         23 characters a(1) through a(23).  The first checksum is to pick a(0) such that
         a(0)+...+a(23)=0x00.  Now pick an arbitrary character c(0).  Compute c(i+1)=[c(i)^a(i)]+d(i)
         where d(i)=0x38,0x0A,0x12,0x26,... for i=0,1,2,3 and repeating with a period of
         4 beyond that.
      <p>We now have c(0)...c(24), giving 25 characters.  The last character c(25) is
         computed soo that c(0)+...+c(25)=0x00.  If both of these checksums are satisfied,
         then the password is valid.
      <p>Regarding the value of each bit, use the following chart (in case the javascript doesn't show up):
      <ul>
         <li>0-3: location
         <li>4-7: olives in BCD, ones place
         <li>8-11: olives in BCD, tens place
         <li>12-16: salamander skins
         <li>17-52: hero name, 0x3F for blank
         <li>53-88: heroine name
         <li>89-94: life
         <li>96: Crystal
         <li>97: Flask

         <li>100: Divine Sword
         <li>101: Nymph Sword
         <li>102: Staff of Fennel
         <li>103: Club
         <li>104: 2nd Heart
         <li>105: 1st Heart
         <li>106: Key
         <li>107: Power Bracelet
         <li>108: Fire Shield
         <li>109: Reflective Shield
         <li>110: Sandals
         <li>111: Moonbeam
         <li>112: Argolis Ambrosia
         <li>113: Phthia Ambrosia
         <li>114: Laconia Ambrosia/Laconia Cyclops Defeated
         <li>115: Peloponessus Ambrosia
         <li>116: Unknown
         <li>117: Zeus
         <li>118: Golden Apple
         <li>119: 3rd Heart
         <li>120: Attica Child Rescued
         <li>121: Lion Defeated
         <li>122: Lamia Defeated
         <li>123: Flask Filled
         <li>124-126: Unknown
         <li>127: Phrygia Ambrosia
         <li>128: Unknown
	 <li>129: Hades Defeated
         <li>130: Siren Defeated
         <li>131: Gaea Defeated
         <li>132: Cyclops Defeated
         <li>133: Hydra Defeated
         <li>134: Fire Obtained
         <li>135: Hermes Summoned by Zeus
         <li>136-138: Unknown
      </ul>
      <p>A note about how I figured this out:
         I began with a list of all 64
         null passwords (names 000000 and not collecting any items - FCEU's "~" 
         key, which runs the game at super speed, made this a LOT easier).  XORing
         any pair of these together, shows strong (but not quite fully-ordered)
         patterns, as well as XORing adjacent bits.  I also XORed with slightly
         more advanced passwords (at a different location, with 1 or more
         olives, etc, and picking the null password that was most similar).
         Finally, what really started to open it up was changing the name by
         one or two letters.  I noticed that there was a single byte, to the
         left of which it matched one null password and the right matched the
         other ("xorpass | grep 00" was a lifesaver, especially since it
         highlights the zeros in red).  In light of that, and noticing repeated
         patterns in the set of null passwords, I tried finding a recursion
         formula for the next letter given the previous that would work for all
         64 passwords with the same meaning, and came up with this XOR-ADD
         pattern.  The checksums were pretty easy since all the characters just
         add to zero, and it was obvious where they were by how passwords
         always changed the first and last characters.
